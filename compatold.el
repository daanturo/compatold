;;; Commentary:

;; To allow for the usage of Emacs functions and macros that are
;; defined in newer versions of Emacs, compatold.el provides definitions
;; that are installed ONLY if necessary.  These reimplementations of
;; functions and macros are at least subsets of the actual
;; implementations.  Be sure to read the documentation string to make
;; sure.
;;
;; Not every function provided in newer versions of Emacs is provided
;; here.  Some depend on new features from the core, others cannot be
;; implemented to a meaningful degree.  Please consult the Compat
;; manual for details.  The main audience for this library are not
;; regular users, but package maintainers.  Therefore commands and
;; user options are usually not implemented here.

;;; Code:

(require 'compatold-24)

(provide 'compatold)
;;; compatold.el ends here
